# Client Task B #
# Add your pseudocode to this file below this line: #

find the spot:

START

1. Define the warehouse as a grid of coordinates (e.g., rows and columns).
2. Set customer's starting position as (startX, startY).
3. Set target location as (targetX, targetY).

4. WHILE (customer's current position != target location):
    a. Calculate the difference between current position and target location:
        i. deltaX = targetX - currentX
        ii. deltaY = targetY - currentY    
    b. IF deltaX > 0:
        i. Move east (increment currentX).
        ii. Print "Move east."
    ELSE IF deltaX < 0:
        i. Move west (decrement currentX).
        ii. Print "Move west."
    
    c. IF deltaY > 0:
        i. Move north (increment currentY).
        ii. Print "Move north."
    ELSE IF deltaY < 0:
        i. Move south (decrement currentY).
        ii. Print "Move south."

5. Once current position equals target location:
    a. Print "You have reached your destination."
